# Visual Sorting aka The Sound Of Sorting

Visual Sorting is a tool that provides a visualization of sorting algorithms, accompanied by an auditory experience. It allows users to witness how various sorting algorithms work through dynamic horizontal bars.

## ðŸš€ Play with it

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Dynamic Visualization**: Vertical bars present the sorting process in real-time.
- **Step-by-Step Exploration**: Go through each step of the algorithm, and analyze what going on.
- **Sound Experience**: Each vertical bar represents a value in the sorting array. As the algorithm works on a bar, a sound is produced based on its height.
- **Input Array Options**: Customize the array to sort by shuffling or reversing. Choose array sizes ranging from 2 to 1000 elements.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Control the pace by dynamically changing the delay, to speed up or slow down the process.
- **Themes**: Various themes from DaisyUI so that everyone can find something for themselves.
